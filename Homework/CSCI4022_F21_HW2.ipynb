    "\n",
    "- Any relevant data sets should be available on Canvas. To make life easier on the graders if they need to run your code, do not change the relative path names here. Instead, move the files around on your computer.\n",
    "- If you're not familiar with typesetting math directly into Markdown then by all means, do your work on paper first and then typeset it later.  Here is a [reference guide](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) linked on Canvas on writing math in Markdown. **All** of your written commentary, justifications and mathematical work should be in Markdown.  I also recommend the [wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) for LaTex.\n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do **Kernel $\\rightarrow$ Restart & Run All** as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",
    "- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** write a summary of the results in Markdown directly below your code. \n",
    "- 45 points of this assignment are in problems.  The remaining 5 are for neatness, style, and overall exposition of both code and text.\n",
    "- This probably goes without saying, but... For any question that asks you to calculate something, you **must show all work and justify your answers to receive credit**. Sparse or nonexistent work will receive sparse or nonexistent credit. \n",
    "- There is *not a prescribed API* for these problems.  You may answer coding questions with whatever syntax or object typing you deem fit.  Your evaluation will primarily live in the clarity of how well you present your final results, so don't skip over any interpretations!  Your code should still be commented and readable to ensure you followed the given course algorithm.\n",

Consider taking all 10! = 3,628,800 possible distinct permutations of ten rows. When we choose a permutation of the rows and produce a minhash value for the column, we will use the number of the row, in the permuted order, that is the first with a 1.

Next, there are four ways to choose our one that sits in the third index. And finally, there are seven more values to permute, which comes out to $7!$.

    "The two french texts (countmc and lesmis) and the two texts written by the same author (BB and awaken) are consistently more similar than other texts regardless of $k$. Further, the translated french text shares a slightly higher similarity score to the other two french texts than with the other texts. Finally, all of the english texts share more similarity with each other than with the french texts. This all makes perfect sense. The only thing I was slightly surprised with, was that with lower values of $k$, the texts written by the same author are less similar to each other than the two french texts written by different authors (although this does make sense upon more thought because the french alphabet is slightly smaller). As we increase $k$ though, the same author's texts become the most similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, I computed the $k$ value with the largest range, and $k=3$ is what produced the largest range. Although this might be the case, I don't necessarily think this is the optimal $k$ value. Something between $6$ and $9$ seems better; moving forward I'll use $k=5$ because minhashing is an estimate of similarity so larger values of $k$ might lose information (much like using too large of a $k$ value with jaccard similarities). In other words, too small of a $k$ value will give us incredibly similar documents regardless, and using too large of a $k$ value will provide diminishing returns.\n",

Thus I settled for $k=5$. It gave me a good balance, and sort of mirrored the jaccard similarities nicely.\n",

    "The two French documents are indeed the most similar, with the two documents written by the same author slightly behind in 2nd place. Finally, the french-to-english text is more similar to english. When I thought about the French texts more, it makes sense that they're the most similar because the number of unique characters is lower than the english texts so theres a smaller problem-space, and a higher probability of sharing shingles because there are less total shingle combinations. The translated text is similar to this train of thought, and it was unsurprising that it shared more similarity with the english texts. Finally, I think the texts by the same author were a good middle of the road for the results we had, because they will definitely be similar, but of course not 100% similarity.\n",
