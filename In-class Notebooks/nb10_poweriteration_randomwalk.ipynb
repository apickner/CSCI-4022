    "PageRank can equivalently be thought of in terms of an imaginary Tron-style person walking around on the internet. As the walker moves, she randomly follows one of the out-links from the current page to another one (possibly back to the current page, if there are self-links). Each step can be considered a point in time, during which the walker is at exactly one of the pages. A page's PageRank is the long-run proportion of time that the walker spends on that page. Here, \"long-run\" means we need the walker to move around for a very long time. If you have taken prob/stats classes covering *Markov chains* before, and/or were paying close attention during lecture, you are probably hissing *stationary distribution!* under your breath. That's perfectly normal.\n",

Then the first column of $M$ defines the probabilities of the walker landing in any of the other pages. In this case, she goes to Page 2 with probability 1 since that is the only out-link from Page 1."
